“What’s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?”

For Lab 4, the website was rendered on my local machine without a server, directly from file paths. In Lab 6, the Hono.js server serves the files over HTTP, which is similar to how a website is accessed on the internet. This allows for better simulation of a web server environment.
